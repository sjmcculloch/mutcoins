    "body": "[Madden 17 Ultimate Team](https://www.easports.com/madden-nfl) is the collectible mode of the popular football video game. You open card packs and assemble your own team of players based on the cards you have in your virtual collection. The more packs you open, the better your team will become. Packs are earnt by playing the game or buying them with real money through the Madden shop.\n\nIf you are __not lucky enough__ to open your favorite players in packs, you can venture into the auction house and buy cards from the auction house using virtual Madden currency (MUT coins). These cards are posted by other players who are looking to sell players they no longer need.  \n\nFor most people, the top level players are out of reach. They don't have coins to purchase them or lack the money to buy packs in the store. But fear not, we've compiled a list of tips on how we built up millions of coins and eventually built a Madden 17 God Squad.\n\n## 1. Solo Challenges\nThe simplest path to obtain MUT coins is by playing the single player mode known as __Solo Challenges__. These are either moments within a game (e.g. rush for a TD) or full games against the computer. \n\n> __Pro Tip__: Some solo challenges are only available for a limited time, so be sure to complete them by the listed end date.\n\nEach solo challenge can offer a coin and/or pack reward. We recommend that everyones first step in MUT is to knockout some solo challenges until you get a reasonable coin balance (20,000+). Once you have done this, you are ready to venture into the auction house.\n\nHowever, not all Solo Challenges are created equal, see our guide on [Making the most of Madden 17 Solo Challenges](https://www.makemutcoins.com) to make the most out of your time. \n\n## 2. Card Sniping in the Auction House\nThe Auction House functions similar to a stock market. Items of value (players) are placed up for auction and bought by other users. At its most simplest, card sniping refers to the ability to buy a card less than it's value. \n\nAssessing a cards value is relatively easy in Madden 17 thanks to the [player database at muthead](http://www.muthead.com/17/players). You can look up a player's sale history to determine their price:\n\n  ![Brian Dawkins on Muthead](//images.contentful.com/nso7hcqr5tuu/yPkZVxMJS8EGQUmUygqgw/ae3b23262da271699af3ea70c082dbd1/dawkins-muthead.PNG)\n\n> __Pro Tip__: Muthead has a mobile app that allows viewing player prices on the fly. ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/muthead/id1144204312?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=curse.media.muthead_android&hl=en))\n\nNow that you have a way to assess value via the player database, it's time to find some players to buy in the auction house. \n\nThere are 3 key principles for buying & selling on the auction house:\n\n- __Taxes__ :: whenever you sell a card on the auction house, EA will take 10%. \n- __Competition__ :: newly posted cards generally offer the most value (other people are sniping too!)\n- __Risk__ :: the higher priced cards have the greater chance to lose money or alternatively higher rewards.\n\n### 2.1 Assessing Card Value for Sniping\n\nAsssuming we would want to make a 10% on every purchase, the formula for assigning value would be:\n\n__Average Card Price x 90% x 90%__ (removal of taxes & allow for 10% profit). If this value is greater than the Buy Now price, it's a buy!\n\n### 2.2 Card Examples\n\nLet's take a look at a live player (Bobby Wagner):\n\n![Bobby Wagner prices PS4 Madden 17 - 2017/04/17](//images.contentful.com/nso7hcqr5tuu/6OoPKqtIYg0c6yssEEgAUK/b3937902335a7afc4f9d6b863522828a/wagner-muthead-2017-04-17.PNG)\n\nWe know from the above screenshot that the average price is __290k (PS4)__. Adjusting for taxes the true value to buy/sell this card is __290k x 90% = 261k__. \n\nLooking at the Live Auction Prices there is one available for __255k__ which would be a __6k profit__. This may look attractive but it's only a *2.3% profit* on our capital (255k). Ideally it would need be at least 10% profit to invest e.g. __(261k x 90%) = 230k__ (you can adjust the % for your own risk appetite but I wouldn't go lower than 5%).\n\n> __Pro Tip__: The above example highlights the Risk principle, the higher priced cards require the highest discounts to snipe (hence harder to find)\n\nHere is a more reasonably priced card (Blake Bortles):\n\n![Blake Bortles Pricing Muthead - 2017-04-017](//images.contentful.com/nso7hcqr5tuu/5dFimMKGZUOYQ4wY40cS8I/305bdd34c664864ad74765ed611b1407/bortles-muthead-2017-04-17.PNG)\n  \nFor Blake Bortles, the average price is __11.8K (PS4)__. For us to make a 10% profit would be __(11.8k x 90% x 90%) = 9.6k__. This is very close to our target figure and we would flip this card because it's such a small investment. We could even list it for __13k__ and still be the cheapest one in the Auction Hall. \n\n### 2.3 Locating Cards within the Auction House\n\nThe above examples show you how to value a card and now you need to find them in the Auction House. At any point in time, thousands of cards are posted for auction. With this amount of volume we'll need \"filters\" to find opportunities for sniping. \n\n> __Pro Tip__: Ideally, we want newly posted cards because of our \"Competition\" principle. Other card snipers are looking for the same cards we are!\n\nWhen we filter cards we're looking to see newly posted cards when sorting by \"New\". To identify newly posted cards they will have an expiry close to their posting time (e.g. 59mins, 7hrs, 11hrs, 23hrs). If your filter is __too generic__ it won't show these cards (it only displays the top 500 organized by their expiry time). \n\nBad Filter: __All Players & 90-94 Quality__\n\n![bad-auction-filter](//images.contentful.com/nso7hcqr5tuu/6zNrQasXwAAqQockuoCmSY/793093714b2e2b3146f7f1690f9a8b41/bad-auction-filter.jpg)\n\nGood Filter: __All Players & 90-94 Quality & {Team}__\n\n![good-auction-filter](//images.contentful.com/nso7hcqr5tuu/2xYyTJQh2YkSUAIUkKkI08/b1ba65827855536c0fb4d15191767032/good-auction-filter.jpg)\n\nAs more cards get added to the game some filters may no longer work. For a full list of active filters, see our [Sniping Filters for Madden 17 page](http://www.makemutcoins.com/madden-sniping-filters).\n\n## 3. Buying from Coin Sellers\nIf you are short of time (but not short on money!) you can buy coins from third party vendors:\n\n![coin-vendors](//images.contentful.com/nso7hcqr5tuu/4cNoPjnSKsqqUcKsSQ0IOy/fca3eb200ab880c3d3ace07f6cc04e21/coin-vendors.PNG)\n\nDeliveries are usually a few hours, here are the steps:\n\n- Place order on X website from third party vendor\n- List one of your players in the auction house for the amount of coins you bought\n- Third party vendor buys your listed card on the auction house\n\n__Be Warned:__ do this at your own risk! EA has stated \"If you intend to purchase, sell, transfer or auction coins or accounts (including pre-loaded accounts) from a third-party website or service with no affiliation to EA, you risk violating EA's User Agreement\". Whether or not they enforce it is another matter.\n\nIf you are done with MUT for the year, many of these vendors will also allow you to sell your coins for real money.\n\n## 4. Buying MUT Packs in the Madden Store\n\nIf you have even more money than option 3, you could buy packs from the Madden store. However, in our experience it's rarely a good deal and often leads to regret! \n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo there you have it, a quick summary of how to make coins in Madden 17 ultimate team. Visit back often for more indepth articles on how to manipulate the auction house so you can form your very own God Squad.\n\n",
